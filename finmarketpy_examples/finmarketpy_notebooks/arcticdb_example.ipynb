    "## What is findatapy\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been working on findatapy (and it's associated libraries) and open sourced it nearly 10 years. The basic idea of findatapy is that it can be used to download market/economic data from many sources using the same interface, and there's also ways to store this data using Parquet files and now, with ArcticDB, which I'll talk about shortly. I use findatapy regularly both in my teaching and we also use it a lot for downloading data at Turnleaf Analytics (https://www.turnleafanalytics.com) where we forecast macro economic data, alongside many proprietary libraries. As a result, it's been maintained quite regularly!"

    "## What is ArcticDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "ArcticDB is a serverless database engine developed by the quant hedge fund Man-AHL which makes it easy to store Pandas DataFrames, which replaces Arctic (which used a MongoDB backend). What are the main reasons to use ArcticDB:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fast\n",
    "    * It is super fast and can process millions of rows a second on disk\n",
    "* Flexible\n",
    "    * You don't need to specify a schema to start, and it also supports versioning (ie. it is bitemporal), so you can see different vintages of the same data.\n",
    "    * This is particularly useful when it comes to storing point-in-time data which is frequently revised (eg. macroeconomic data)\n",
    "    * It supports many different disk storage backends including `lmdb` (local disk backend), `mem` (in memory mostly for testing) and various buckets (including `s3`, `azure` etc.)\n",
    "* Familiar\n",
    "    * If you already know Python and Pandas then it's fairly straightforward\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that it isn't a transactional database, so it isn't a replacement for databases like PostgresSQL or MySQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full documentation for ArcticDB can be found at https://docs.arcticdb.io/latest\n",
    "\n",
    "We've added support for ArcticDB in findatapy to make it easy to download market/economic data with findatapy and then store/retrieve in ArcticDB."

It already comes out of the box, with `dukascopy` ticker mappings predefined, but these are all customisable. Note, that we haven't used the `data_engine` property. If this isn't set, then findatapy will download from our data source directly."

    "## What is S3?\n",
    "\n",
    "S3 is basically storage in the cloud, which is managed by AWS. Dump as much data as want from anywhere on the web and you don't need to worry about scaling your storage, which you'd obviously have to do in your own data centre, and also manage backups. Data is stored in S3 buckets, which are a bit like folders. Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is the equivalent on Google Cloud and Azure Blob is a similar service on Azure."

    "## What is the cost of S3?\n",
    "There are many other AWS storage services which you can find at https://aws.amazon.com/products/storage/, which are at different price levels and performance too. It is important to use the right services for storage which have the right performance cost balance for your specific use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of S3 depends upon factors like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* how much data you store?\n",
    "* which service you use (are you using S3 Standard Storage for example, or S3 Infrequent Access Storage)?\n",
    "* how many requests you make for the data (PUT/GET etc.)?\n",
    "* which region is it in?\n",
    "* how much data you transfer from S3 out to the internet?\n",
    "\n",
    "An article on cloudhealthtech.com goes through the various ins and outs of the pricing at https://www.cloudhealthtech.com/blog/s3-cost-aws-cloud-storage-costs-explained. They note that the storage cost for Standard S3 (Nov 2020) is around 0.021 to 0.026 USD per month per GB. So for 1 TB that's around 21-26 USD per month, roughly under 300 USD per year. This excludes any of the various request costs for example, which you need to take into account. The actual cost of a hardware is a lot cheaper (a quick browse of 1 TB drives online, suggested a cost of around 50 USD), but if we manage our own hardware, we need to take into hassle of managing it, including stuff like backup, convenience of access etc. The cost of losing data is likely to be significant if we choose to host our data locally."

    "## Making AWS accessible via Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that S3 is in the cloud, we need to make sure that AWS services need to be accessible from Python, whether we are running our process in the cloud (which seems preferable to reduce latency) or locally. Whilst we are using Python, S3 is also accessible from many other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hence, before going through this tutorial, you'll need to go through several steps so AWS services are accessible from your machine\n",
    "    * You'll need to create an IAM user, with appropriate permissions at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam when you are logged into the AWS Console\n",
    "        * In our case this will to have permissions to use S3\n",
    "        * Get the Access key ID and secret access key for the IAM user\n",
    "        * If you want to make S3 accessible to users outside of your AWS account, I found this explanation at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45336781/amazon-s3-access-for-other-aws-accounts\n",
    "        * Before changing any access rights to S3, I'd strongly recommend reading https://aws.amazon.com/s3/security/ which explains the various security mechanisms including being able to block any public access at all\n",
    "    * Install AWS CLI\n",
    "        * run `sudo apt install awscli`\n",
    "        * or you can download the zip file\n",
    "        * run `aws configure` to set the default access key ID, default AWS availability zone etc.\n",
    "        * this will create files in ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config\n",
    "    * AWS CLI instructions at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html#cliv2-linux-install\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once your  credentials are set, we can use boto3, which is an SDK for Python developers to access AWS resources:\n",
    "    * `boto3` instructions https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html\n",
    "    * You can install `boto3` using pip\n",
    "    * You also need to install `s3fs` using pip to get access to S3 via Python\n",
    "    * If you follow the instructions at https://github.com/cuemacro/teaching/blob/master/pythoncourse/installation/installing_anaconda_and_pycharm.ipynb - you'll create a conda environment `py38class` which includes boto3, and many useful data science libraries, which I use for my Python teaching\n",

It already comes out of the box, with Dukascopy ticker mappings predefined, but these are all customisable. Note, that we haven't used the `data_engine` property. If this isn't set, then findatapy will download from our data source directly."
